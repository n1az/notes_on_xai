Cluster-based visualization techniques in explainable AI (xAI) focus on grouping similar explanations to better understand the model's behavior.

1. **SHAP Clustering**: This method uses SHAP values to explain model predictions and clusters these values to identify patterns and outliers. For more information, you can refer to the paper "Explainable artificial intelligence: a comprehensive review"[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-021-10088-y].

2. **t-SNE and UMAP for High-Dimensional Data**: These dimensionality reduction techniques are used to visualize high-dimensional data like SHAP values or feature importance vectors, effectively clustering similar explanations. A relevant paper is "Explainable AI: current status and future directions" which discusses these techniques[https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07045].

3. **Hierarchical Clustering of Feature Importance**: Applying hierarchical clustering to feature importance vectors can create a dendrogram that groups similar instances, providing insights into model decisions. The paper "Decision support for efficient XAI services" might provide further insights[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-022-00603-6].

4. **Activation Atlases**: By aggregating activations across many datapoints, this technique creates a high-level overview of the types of features a neural network is detecting. Although not a paper, the concept is well explained in the Distill.pub article "Activation Atlas[https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04982].

5. **Projection-Based Clustering**: Methods like PCA are used to project feature importance vectors onto lower dimensions, followed by clustering to group similar explanations. The paper "Beyond explaining: XAI-based Adaptive Learning with SHAP Clustering for ..." discusses an approach integrating XAI techniques with adaptive learning[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2107.07045].

6. **Feature Visualization**: This involves generating images that maximize the activation of individual neurons or channels, then clustering these images to understand what features the model has learned. explain and include link to the research paper[https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901].
